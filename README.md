# Game Dev Boot Camp
### November 19 and 20 - Cal State East Bay

Do you love playing games? We do, too! Ever wonder how to make your own game? We do, too! That's why we're inviting you to participate in an exclusive, two-day, first ever Game Development Bootcamp designed for students from all backgrounds and skills to join in a series of workshops held over the course of a weekend.  You can choose from one or take all workshops.  Unlock your creativity  and level up your skills. Use them any time or at the CSU east Bay Game Jams this Winter and Spring.
